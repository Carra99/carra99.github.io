## About
Originally from Tuscany, Italy. Currently a PhD student at [WIS](https://www.weizmann.ac.il) in [Ruth Scherz-Shouval lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/Biomolecular_Sciences/Shouval/home). 

**Outside the lab**: 
Addicted to running to escape the troubles of daily life.

## Projects
I'm working on a project at the intersection of cancer and spatial biology, trying to understand how tissue organization changes in the context of cancer.
